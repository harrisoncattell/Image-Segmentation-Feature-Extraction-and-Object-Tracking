#### Image Segmentation, Feature Extraction and Object Tracking

## Introduction

This project is centred around image processing and computer vision in MATLAB. The project consists of 3 task files

## Prerequisites

The functions all require MATLAB in order to run

## Tasks
# Task 1

This task involves 3 images of skin lesions, the function process these lesion images and produces a segmentation that highlights the lesion seperately from the skin and hair around it.

The DICE score is calculate against the supplied ground-truth data.

# Task 2

This task involves gathering stastitics regarding the co-occurance matrix created for an input image

# Task 3

This task involves carrying out Kalman Tracking of a set of noisey coordinates. The function also caluclates the Root-Mean-Square using the ground-truth coordinates
